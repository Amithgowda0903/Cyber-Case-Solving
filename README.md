# Cyber-Case-Solving
Repository of my solved cybersecurity and digital forensics cases. Includes practical investigations, PCAP/file analysis, incident response, and threat-hunting write-ups.

# [Case 1: hydranet_artifacts Case](https://github.com/Amithgowda0903/Cyber-Case-Solving/tree/main/hydranet_artifacts)
A mysterious trail of digital fragments hidden deep within a compromised system. This case dives into unraveling encrypted traces, obscure logs, and anomalous patterns left behind by a stealthy actor. Every artifact tells a story — but only if you can connect the dots. Was it an intrusion? A data siphon? Or something far more deceptive?

# [Case 2: black_swan_artifacts Case](https://github.com/Amithgowda0903/Cyber-Case-Solving/tree/main/black_swan_artifacts)
A case wrapped in shadows and anomalies. Black Swan pushes the boundaries of forensic investigation — where hidden payloads, obfuscated traffic, and unusual binaries paint a picture that’s darker than it first appears. Was this just noise, or a sophisticated attempt at covert persistence? The deeper you go, the more unsettling the puzzle becomes.

# [Case 4 : Memory-leakage Case](https://github.com/Amithgowda0903/Cyber-Case-Solving/tree/main/Memory-leakage)
A silent bleed hidden in plain sight. What seems like a healthy system slowly unravels as memory vanishes without a trace. Digging deeper reveals phantom processes, concealed mismanagement, and the possibility of something far more sinister. Is this just bad coding, or a deliberate attempt at sabotage cloaked in instability?

# [Case 5 : Drug_Dealer_case](https://github.com/Amithgowda0903/Cyber-Case-Solving/tree/main/Drug_Dealer_Case)
Behind casual browsing lies a darker marketplace. Buried in Craigslist ads, Gmail exchanges, and Bitcoin wallets is the shadowy outline of an illicit trade. Each browser history entry is a breadcrumb, each database record a clue. Was it a careless user trail, or the digital skeleton of a dealer who thought he couldn’t be traced?
