# Cyber-Case-Solving
My personal archive of solved cybersecurity cases from network traffic analysis to malware investigations. Each case is documented with methodology, findings, and lessons learned.

# Case 1: hydranet_artifacts Case
A mysterious trail of digital fragments hidden deep within a compromised system. This case dives into unraveling encrypted traces, obscure logs, and anomalous patterns left behind by a stealthy actor. Every artifact tells a story — but only if you can connect the dots. Was it an intrusion? A data siphon? Or something far more deceptive?

# Case 2: black_swan_artifacts Case
A case wrapped in shadows and anomalies. Black Swa pushes the boundaries of forensic investigation — where hidden payloads, obfuscated traffic, and unusual binaries paint a picture that’s darker than it first appears. Was this just noise, or a sophisticated attempt at covert persistence? The deeper you go, the more unsettling the puzzle becomes.
